## Design Detailed Document (DDD)
  
1. Description: 
This work is a compilation of knowledge acquired throughout the semester on HTML 
and CSS in the subject of fundamentals of computer engineering. It is a personal 
web page, in which there are several pages that talk about different things (my 
career, my personal information...) and a more personal one about a free topic, in 
my case basketball. It is composed of two main files, the index.html and the 
style.css. In the index is where the web page is structured and the main page is 
created that will direct you to the other pages. In the style.css the code necessary 
for the design of the web page is stored.

2. Problems during the development: 
Linking the repository to the project. I made a first attempt and finished the 
project, but I don't know why the project was not well linked to the repository 
and I couldn't push the changes after committing, so I had to delete the 
repository and repeat the job with a new repository. 
Linking between pages. During the project I had to change the linking to the 
different pages too many times. I could get it to work, but then I couldn't go 
back through the pages, or I just couldn't find the files. My first solution was 
to put the absolute paths as /docs/public/... which worked if I did a live 
preview in VS, since I created a server on localhost and found the path. I 
realized later that if I opened the index from the file explorer, neither the link 
to the style.css nor the linking to the other pages was ok, so I simply changed 
to a relative linking, and it worked.

3. Conclusions: 
The work has been very useful, because apart from having to apply the knowledge 
and finish strengthening it, you get into the world of development in a more realistic 
way, running into problems and having to solve them. I have developed skills that I 
think will be useful throughout the degree and I will be able to apply in other projects.
